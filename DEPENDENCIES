procmail-pre depends on idanlib, which you can fetch from the following
URL and compile:

  https://github.com/00shoham/idanlib

idanlib also has a few dependencies.  If you are on Ubuntu, you can
satisfy them with this command:

  apt install git gcc make libcurl4-gnutls-dev liblua5.3-dev uuid-dev

Here is how you get and build idanlib:

  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/00shoham/idanlib.git idanlib
  cd idanlib/src
  make

Here is how you get, build and install procmail-pre:

  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/00shoham/procmail-pre.git procmail-pre
  cd procmail-pre/src
  make install

Note that 'make install' will run 'install' as root via sudo and sudo
will prompt you for your password.  This pre-supposes that your login
is able to perform 'sudo bash' or similar, for example by being in the
sudo group in /etc/groups.
