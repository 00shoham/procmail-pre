procmail-pre

Overview

  procmail-pre is a filter for e-mail messages.  It is intended to be called by
  procmail, to "pre-process" one message at a time, before applying matching rules and
  actions.

What problem is this trying to solve?

  procmail is a great tool for automatically filing and forwarding messages.
  It is stable, reasonably fast and quite flexible.

  Unfortunately, it is also very old, and e-mails today don't look like
  e-mails did in the 1990s.  Specifically, procmail sometimes fails to
  match "modern" e-mails because:

  * They often contain multiple MIME attachments, and the message body itself
    may be an attachment of type text/plain, text/html or both.

  * Even subject lines and other headers may be in UTF-8 or some other encoding,
    and encoded in a manner that makes them compatible with old mail protocols
    but impossible to read unless decoded.

  * The entire message (and possibly one or more attachments) may be encoded
    as quoted-printable, resulting in keywords that a matching rule might
    look for being broken up across lines of text (and failing to match).

  * Message headers can be very long and are often broken down into
    multiple parts across different lines of text.  This can also
    cause matching problems.

  If you like procmail, want to use it, but want it to handle "modern"
  e-mails where plaintext matching against simple, one-line message headers
  in US-ASCII encoding or against plaintext message text doesn't work, then
  this pre-processor is for you!

How to use it?

  * First, you have to write a configuration file for the pre-processor.
    This is separate from the .procmailrc file -- it tells the pre-processor
    what kinds of manipulation you want to perform on each message (one
    message at a time, just like procmail).

  * Next, you tell procmail to pre-process messages by adding this recipe
    like the following near the top of your .procmailrc file:

    :0fw
    | /usr/local/bin/procmail-pre -config $HOME/procmail-pre.conf -message -

The procmail-pre configuration file

  As described above, we need to also write a configuration file.  This is
  a text file where every line is a directive.  The configuration file
  can include blank lines and comments (lines that begin with the # mark).

  The directives are:

  # Causes procmail-pre to merge multi-line message headers into single,
  # long header lines:
  MERGE-HEADER-LINES

  # Replaces headers encoded as =?UTF-8?B?...base64text...?=
  # with the actual decoded byte stream.
  DECODE-HEADER-LINES
  
  # Searches for literals or regular expressions (see below) in the message
  # body, and for the first match on any given pattern, adds a header
  # in the format shown below:
  # KeywordMatch: <matchingtext>
  # procmail will then be able to match on this (new, inserted) header instead of
  # scanning the message body itself.
  SEARCH-MESSAGE

  # Searches base64 encoded MIME attachments, whose content type
  # has the word "text" in it (i.e., text/html or text/plain), for
  # keywords.
  SEARCH-ATTACHMENTS

  # Search the message body and/or attachments (see above) for a
  # literal sequence of characters, specified after the space that
  # follows the LITERAL keyword.
  LITERAL Hello, World!

  # Search the message body and/or attachments (see above) for a
  # sequence of characters that matches a regular expression.
  REGEX Hel.*old

Changes to the .procmailrc file

  When you use procmail-pre, you will need to change your
  .procmailrc file in two ways:

  * Filter messages before applying matching rules, as described earlier.


  * Instead of searching the message body in rule, which may not
    work anyways because of mime-encoded content, look for a
    KeywordMatch: header.

    i.e., 

    BEFORE (and not working for some messages):

      .procmailrc:
      ===========

      :0H
      * From: someone@somedomain.com
      * some text in body
      ! bounce@otherdomain.com

    AFTER

      .procmailrc:
      ===========

      :0fw
      | procmail-pre -config $HOME/procmail-pre.conf -message -

      :0
      * From: someone@somedomain.com
      * KeywordMatch: some text in body
      ! bounce@otherdomain.com

      procmail-pre.conf:
      =================

      MERGE-HEADER-LINES
      DECODE-HEADER-LINES
      SEARCH-MESSAGE
      SEARCH-ATTACHMENTS
      LITERAL some text in body
